# SERVERS
- I'm building an E-learning platform, and I will teach programming languages like JavaScript, C++, GO and Python.
- Because I have basic training, and the goal of the platform is to build real world projects, building an http and dns server should build my understanding of necessary concepts in Programming and Networking
- The servers will be built in with the GO programming language, I belive this will give me real world skill to teach.
